This is ubf-abnf, a framework for integrating UBF and ABNF.  This
repository depends on the ubf and abnfc open source repositories.


To build
========

1. Get and install an erlang system
   (http://www.erlang.org)

2. Get and install ubf
   (http://github.com/norton/ubf)

3. Get and install abnfc
   (http://github.com/nygge/abnfc)   

4. Change to the src directory and type make
   $ cd src
   $ make

5. Run the unit test
   $ make check


Documentation -- Where should I start?
======================================

This README is a good first step.  Check out and build using the "To
build" instructions above.

ABNF samples and eunit tests can be found in the Unit-EUnit-Files
directory.


What is UBF?
============

UBF is the "Universal Binary Format", designed and implemented by Joe
Armstrong.  See http://www.sics.se/~joe/ubf.html for full details.  A
really short summary:

   * UBF(A) is a protocol above a stream transport (e.g. TCP/IP), for
     encoding structured data roughly equivalent to well-formed XML.

   * UBF(B) is a programming langauge for describing types in UBF(A)
     and protocols between clients and servers. UBF(B) is roughly
     equivalent to to Verified XML, XML-schemas, SOAP and WDSL.

     
What is ABNF?
=============

Augmented Backus–Naur Form (ABNF) is a metalanguage based on
Backus–Naur Form (BNF), but consisting of its own syntax and
derivation rules.

   * The motive principle for ABNF is to describe a formal system of a
     language to be used as a bidirectional communications protocol.
   
   * It is defined by Internet Standard 68 (STD 68), which as of May
     2008 is RFC 5234, and it often serves as the definition language
     for IETF communication protocols.

     
Credits
=======

Many, many thanks to Joe Armstrong, UBF's designer and original
implementor.

Thanks to Anders Nygren, ABNFC's designer and implementor.  ABNFC is a
parser generator for Erlang.  UBF-ABNF relies on the ABNFC application
for parsing ABNF into a symbolic form.
